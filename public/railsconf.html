        <p>As part of a larger effort to welcome the Rails community to Baltimore for RailsConf 2010, B'more on Rails has organized a room-share for RailsConf attendees. We have 12 private rooms available to attendees for the duration of the conference. We see it as an opportunity to welcome you to our city and for us to create a few new friendships.</p>

        <h2>Recommended Running Routes</h2>
        <p>A breezy run on the water is a great way to start your morning in Baltimore! Below is a sample running route starting from the Inner Harbor, which is just a few blocks east of the Convention Center. It goes up onto Federal Hill, then back around through Harbor East, Fells Point, and Canton, before returning to the Inner Harbor. Much of the course is along the water and is flat and very scenic!</p>
